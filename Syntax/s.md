# JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript uses a C-style syntax that includes statements, variables, operators, and more. In this section, we'll explore the basic syntax elements of JavaScript.

## Statements

JavaScript code consists of one or more statements, which are executed sequentially. Statements are typically terminated by a semicolon (;), although it's not always required.

Example:
```javascript
let greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
